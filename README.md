### Application functions

The Filmopedia Application provides a collection of movies, that can be viewed by registered users. User data is also stored in a collection and API calls are made

### Setting up the tools:

First up, make sure you have parcel installed globally. Parcel is the bundler that is used to bundle the application and make it accessible in your browser.

Do this by typing

```
$ npm install --global parcel@next
```

in your terminal

You can now download the repo to your computer, install the necessary modules by running:

```
$ npm install
```

Make sure there were no errors installing the necessary modules to your application.

### Start the application

Now start the development server by typing

```
$ parcel src/index.html
```

the path to index.html is supposed to be put behind the parcel command, in this case _parcel src/index.html_

or

```
$ npm run dev
```

The console shows you the port on which the application is rendered. If your browser, doesn't open automatically, open it manually and navigate to the URL given in the terminal, in most cases: http://localhost:3000
